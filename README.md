    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

Fellow students have put together a guide to Windows set-up for the project [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/files/Kidnapped_Vehicle_Windows_Setup.pdf) if the environment you have set up for the Sensor Fusion projects does not work for this project. There's also an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3).

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./


## Reflection
##### Final Parameter Values
The final parameter values were
| Parameter | Value         | 
| :----------:|:-------------:| 
| Kp        | 0.12 | 
| Ki        | 0       | 
| Kd        | 0.025      |   
##### Role of Each PID Component

Proportional (Kp): This component the serves the primary role of correcting in proportion to the immediate error value.
Integral (Ki): This component the serves the primary role of correcting for systematic bias such as steering drift. 
Derivative (Kp): This component the serves the primary role of damping oscillations and preventing overshoot.
##### Tuning Process
__The parameters were tuned empirically:__
* The Kp value was increased in an attempt to strengthen the corrective power of the control enough to make the sharpest turns on the track. 
* As Kp was increased oscillations would occur, so Kd would be increased to dampen the oscillations. 
* The optimal Ki value was found to be zero, because the simulator car does not seem to have any sources of systematic bias.  

__Discovered Parameter Constraints:__
* If Kd was too high relative to Kp then the controller would become too slow and sharp turns could no longer be made. 
* If Kp was too high relavtive to Kd then it would begin oscillating again. 
* If the value of Kp was too high relative to the speed then the car would be able to stay on the track but the steering angle would reach values that were too high to be safe and comfortable. 
* If the vaule of Kp was too low relative to the speed then sharp turns were not feasible because CTE correction was not fast enough.

##### Conclusion
The current paramter values are optimized for traversing the simulator track at a fixed speed (just under 30mph). The "final pid.mov" file in the project folder shows the PID's performance under the given conditions. 

If the speed or the track were changed then the paramters would likely have to be re-tuned. The experimental parameter contraints outlined would be relevant under the new conditions, so they could be used to effectively re-tune the parameters.

To make the control more robust, instead of using a fixed throttle, another PID could be added to control throttle, which would make the driving more versatile and human-like.
